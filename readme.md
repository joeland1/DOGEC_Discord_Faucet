Information: Just was thinking, a faucet would be a good idea to try and help grow the community, especially if the bot can be used in multiple servers. Just hook the bot up, have the bot stake, and give out DOGEC.

wtf, i have to try a third time cuz even though i did everything right, it aint giving me coins /tableflip
